# Todo_Api

I1mplemented a Todo Api using ExpressJs and MySQL. Performed CRUD operation in which used POST, PUT, GET and DELETE method of express.
 
# ExpressJs
Express is a fast, assertive, essential and moderate web framework of Node.js. You can assume express as a layer built on the top of the NodeJs that helps manage a server and routes. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

# MySQL
MySQL is a relational database management system. This is the place where you store information for your websites.
 
# CRUD
CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE respectively). This is what each operation does:
Create (POST) - Make something
Read (GET)_- Get something
Update (PUT) - Change something
Delete (Delete) - Remove something
If we put CRUD, Express and MySQL together into a single diagram, this is what it would look like:
